#SubSpec
It is the World Of Warcraft addon that allows to create a profiles of talents and switch between them by one button.

#Installation
Just copy **SpellDamage** folder to **World of Warcraft\\Interface\\AddOns\\**.

#Note
Support user interfaces: standard, ElvUI.

A profile saves talent spells position on the action bars.

The switching between profiles make interface freeze for a second.  
Unfortunately it is only one way to switch more then one talent.
